## Statistics for Psychology  

Sample material for an introductory course in statistics predominantly taught to educate psychology majors and minors in data analysis and hypothesis testing. The course covers basic *descriptive* and *inferential* statistics with a dual focus on conceptual and computational understanding.

The primary goal is for students to improve their ability to understand, evaluate, and use statistical information as a mode of critical thought and reason when faced with situations that require quantifiable information.
