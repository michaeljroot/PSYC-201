## Statistics for Psychology  

Sample material for an introductory course in statistics predominantly taught to educate psychology majors and minors in data analysis and hypothesis testing. The course covers basic *descriptive* and *inferential* statistics with a dual focus on conceptual and computational understanding.\

The primary goal is for students to understand, evaluated, and use statistical information as a mode of critical thinking and reason.
